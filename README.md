# BATTLESHIPS <img src= assets/Explosion.png height=50 width=50 />

## Overview
This was my first front-end development project, created as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

My task was to create a grid-based game renderd in the browser that utilised Javascript, HTML and CSS. I decided to create an online version of the classic game Battleships. 

Try it out [here](https://jamesnicholasryan.github.io/Battleships/)! 

The game was to be created as a solo project nad completed within one week. 


## Brief
- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- *The game should be one player, with the computer placing its pieces randomly at the start of the game*
- *The computer should be able to make random attacks on the player's board*

When I had a basic game complete, I aimed for these extra goals:
- Responsive design, for mobile and web
- More intelligent attacks by the computer
- Visual enhancements (ship indicators etc.)


## Technologies used
- Javascript (ES6)
- HTML5
- CSS
- Pro Tools
- GIMP
- Git & GitHub
